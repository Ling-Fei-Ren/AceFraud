This is the code for our paper [IGNAS: An Imbalanced Graph Neural Architecture Search Framework for Fraud Detection] It is a differentiable architecture search for fraud detection.

Requirementsï¼š

torch-geometric==1.6.3

Instructions to run the experiment


Step 1. Run the search process, given different random seeds. (The yelpchi dataset is used as an example)

python train_search.py  --data yelp --fix_last True  --epochs 20


Step 2. Fine tune the searched architectures. You need specify the arch_filename with the resulting filename from Step 1.

python fine_tune.py --data yelp  --fix_last True   --hyper_epoch 50  --arch_filename exp_res/yelp.txt   
Step 2 is a coarse-graind tuning process, and the results are saved in a picklefile in the directory tuned_res.
